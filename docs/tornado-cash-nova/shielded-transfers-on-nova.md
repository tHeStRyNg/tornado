# Shielded Transfers on Nova

One of the specificity of Tornado Cash Nova is the introduction of shielded transfers. It allows shielded transactions of deposited tokens while staying within the pool.

So far, to transfer the custody of deposited funds, tokens needed to be withdrawn first. With Nova, you will be able to transfer a chosen amount of your shielded balance (not necessarily all of it) to another address without needing to withdraw them from the pool.

These shielded transfers can be made to any address of your choice, as long as this address is shielded (i.e. already registered to Tornado Cash Nova pool).

As a reminder, a shielded address is registered either through the `Set up account` action or alongside an initial deposit from a wallet address.

We advise you to double-check the shielded address to which you transfer tokens as this action is irreversible.
